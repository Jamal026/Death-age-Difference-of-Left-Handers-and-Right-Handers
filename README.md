Utilizing Jupyter Notebook provided a versatile and interactive environment for conducting statistical analysis and data manipulation tasks. Within Jupyter Notebook, numpy and pandas were instrumental tools. Numpy, a powerful numerical computing library, facilitated efficient handling of arrays and matrices, essential for various statistical computations. Meanwhile, pandas, a data manipulation library, enabled seamless data manipulation and exploration, including tasks such as data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation. Together, these tools empowered the exploration and analysis of the dataset, allowing for robust statistical analysis and insightful interpretation of the findings related to handedness and lifespan dynamics.
